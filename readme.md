3. **Kickstart Mining**:
   - Now you're all set! Use the command below to get your new GPU server up and runningâ€”from 0 to full speed mining:
   ```bash
   apt update && apt -y install wget && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JozefJarosciak/xgpu/main/gpu.sh && chmod +x gpu.sh && ./gpu.sh



# Execute multi deployment 
Same idea as above, but now you can run multi-GPU with one command (if you order such a setup.
```
apt update && apt -y install wget && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JozefJarosciak/xgpu/main/gpu2.sh && chmod +x gpu2.sh && ./gpu2.sh
```

# USEFUL COMMANDS 

Tail logs:
```
tail -f /XENGPUMiner/miner.log
tail -f /XENGPUMiner/xengpuminer.log
```

Maintenance kill multiple instances when needed
```
pkill -f "xengpuminer"
```
